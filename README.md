# BluePlanet Landing Page

This project is a Vite-powered React application that showcases the BluePlanet landing page. The original in-app newsletter storage has been removed. Instead, the repository now includes [`index.php`](index.php), a minimal PHP email sign-up form that captures addresses without any external dependencies.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (already provided in this workspace):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Launch the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Create an optimized production build when you're ready to deploy:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Serve the files from `dist/` with your preferred static host.

## Minimal PHP email sign-up form

* [`index.php`](index.php) is a single-file email capture form that runs on any PHP 8+ host.
* Submissions are validated server-side and appended to `emails.txt` in the same directory with an ISO-8601 timestamp.
* The generated `emails.txt` file is ignored by Git to keep accidental signups out of version control.

### Deploying the PHP form

1. Copy `index.php` (and an optional empty `emails.txt`) to a PHP-enabled web server.
2. Ensure the directory is writable by the web server user so new signups can be appended.
3. Visit the page and submit an email addressâ€”the form handles everything else.

### Saving signups to GitHub instead of a flat file

If you prefer to store addresses in a GitHub repository, replace the `file_put_contents()` block in `index.php` with the following snippet. Set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with permissions to update the target repository before deploying.

```php
$token = getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN');
$repo = 'yourusername/newsletter-data';
$path = 'emails.txt';
$emailLine = $emailValue . ',' . date('c') . "\n";

$apiUrl = "https://api.github.com/repos/$repo/contents/$path";
$options = [
    'http' => [
        'header' => [
            'Authorization: token ' . $token,
            'User-Agent: SimpleSignup',
            'Content-Type: application/json',
        ],
        'method' => 'GET',
    ],
];

$current = @file_get_contents($apiUrl, false, stream_context_create($options));
$data = json_decode($current, true);
$sha = $data['sha'] ?? null;
$existing = base64_decode($data['content'] ?? '');
$newContent = base64_encode($existing . $emailLine);

$payload = json_encode([
    'message' => 'add ' . $emailValue,
    'content' => $newContent,
    'sha' => $sha,
]);

$options['http']['method'] = 'PUT';
$options['http']['content'] = $payload;

file_get_contents($apiUrl, false, stream_context_create($options));
```

This mirrors the logic from the README instructions so you can keep using Git history as a simple backing store.
